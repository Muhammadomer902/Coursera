I did the course "Build Your Portfolio Website with HTML and CSS" on Coursera.
Here is the Project.
You can download the images from the Images folder or to save yourself some-time download "Images.zip" and extract all images from it.
If you want to it go to:- https://www.coursera.org/projects/build-portfolio-website-html-css
